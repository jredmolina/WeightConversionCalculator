# WeightConversionCalculator
Weight Conversion Calculator is a simple weight conversion tool that converts inputted numeric values to different units.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:
1. Xcode: The Xcode IDE is required for developing and running Swift applications. You can download it from the Mac App Store or the Apple Developer website.
2. Swift: Xcode comes bundled with the Swift compiler, so you don't need to install Swift separately. However, it's good to ensure that you have the latest version of Xcode installed, which includes the latest Swift updates.
3. macOS: Swift development is primarily targeted for macOS, so make sure you have a compatible version of macOS installed on your machine.

## Getting Started
To open and run the Swift app, follow these steps:
1. Clone the Repository: Begin by cloning the repository containing the Swift app source code to your local machine. You can use a Git client or download the source code as a ZIP file and extract it.
2. Open Xcode: Launch Xcode on your macOS system.
3. Open the Project: In Xcode, go to File > Open and navigate to the location where you cloned the repository. Select the .xcodeproj or .xcworkspace file to open the project.
4. Configure Project Settings: Depending on the project, you may need to configure project settings such as the target deployment device, build configuration, or signing capabilities. Consult the project documentation or README file for specific instructions.
5. Select a Simulator or Device: Choose a simulator or connect a physical device for running the app. In Xcode's toolbar, select a target device from the device selection dropdown menu.
6. Build and Run: Click the "Build and Run" button (looks like a Play button) in the Xcode toolbar, or press Cmd + R. Xcode will compile the code, build the app, and launch it in the selected simulator or device.
7. Test and Interact: Once the app is running, you can interact with it as you would on an actual device or simulator. Test various features, inputs, and functionalities to ensure everything is working as expected.
